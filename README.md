Cyber Business

A terminal-based, cyberpunk-themed business simulation game built with Python.

This is a simple project I made while learning Python, to practice what I've learned and to get a better understanding of classes.

It fully runs in the terminal.

To install and run the game on Linux and MacOs : 

git clone https://github.com/hedi0410/cyber_business.git

cd cyber_business (to navigate to the game's folder)

python main.py (to run the game)
